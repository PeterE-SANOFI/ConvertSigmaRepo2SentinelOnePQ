detection:
    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\tpsvc.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\program files\VMWare\VMWare Tools\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\VMWare\VMWare Tools\*'
            - 'c:\program files\Common Files\ThinPrint\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\Common Files\ThinPrint\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
