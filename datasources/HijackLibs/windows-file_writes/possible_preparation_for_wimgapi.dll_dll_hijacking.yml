detection:
    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\wimgapi.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\windows\system32\*'
            - 'c:\windows\syswow64\*'
            - 'c:\program files\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\arm64\DISM\*'

            - 'c:\$windows.~bt\*'
            - 'c:\windows\softwaredistribution\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
