detection:
    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\vstdlib_s64.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\program files\Steam\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\Steam\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
