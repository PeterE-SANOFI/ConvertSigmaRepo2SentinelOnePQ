detection:
    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\qtgui4.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\program files\Audacity\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\Audacity\*'
            - 'c:\program files\AOMEI\AOMEI Backupper\*\*'
            - 'c:\program files (x86)\AOMEI\AOMEI Backupper\*\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
