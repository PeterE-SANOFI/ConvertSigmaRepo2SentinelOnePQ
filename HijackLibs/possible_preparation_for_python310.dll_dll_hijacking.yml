    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\python310.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\program files\Python310\*'

            - 'c:\program files (x86)\DWAgent\runtime\*'
            - '%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
