    selection:
        TargetFileName: '*\icmp.dll'
    filter:
        TargetFileName:
            - 'c:\windows\system32\*'

            - 'c:\windows\winsxs\*'

            - 'c:\windows\softwaredistribution\*'

    condition: selection and not filter
falsepositives:
    - False positives are likely. This rule is more suitable for hunting than for generating detections.
